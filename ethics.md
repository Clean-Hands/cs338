# **Scenario 2: Your Company's Customers' Personal Data**

1. Identify the main ethical question or questions faced by the main character ("you") in the scenario. This will certainly include "what should you do?", but there may be other interesting questions to consider.

   1. Should you cave to the CEO’s desires and start tracking the user’s data?

   2. Or should you stick with the principles of the CTO and keep their data private?

   3. Is this a necessary use of users’ personal data?

   4. How will this affect the users in the long term?

   5. What are the ethical ramifications to do with the fact that the company still has access to past users data that it claimed to delete?

2. For each stakeholder (or category of stakeholders) in the scenario, identify the stakeholder's relevant rights.

   1. User: has a right to have their location data private. Old users also have a right to not have their old location data stored especially if there was no indication that it would be.

   2. CEO: they want to make as much money as they can on their users so if they can harvest the user’s data and sell it they will. They probably have some rights to the data they collect while users use their service, and so they have the right to sell it.

   3. CTO: They have the right to their own opinion and if that means they don’t agree with the CEO then so be it. Furthermore as head of Technology, ultimately, they should be the one to guide the technological decisions.

   4. You: Similarly to the CTO, you have the right to your own opinion. It may or may not affect your employment in the future, but you are allowed to disagree with your employer. The CEO, however, does have the right to fire you if you aren’t following their instructions, so it all depends on how highly you value your morals and how easy it would be to get a new job.

3. List any information missing from the scenario that you would like to have to help you make better choices.

   1. How is the current location data stored in the logs (encrypted vs plaintext)?

   2. What precautions will be taken to ensure that the location data sold remains completely anonymized to protect client privacy?

   3. Will users be notified of the changes to how their data is used?

   4. Will users be able to opt-out at any point?

4. Describe your possible actions, and discuss the likely consequences of those actions.

   1. Implement the feature how you envisioned it by ignoring the CEO

      Consequence: Probably getting fired for not going through with the CEO’s vision.

   2. Speak to the CEO about the possibility of his suggestion infringing on client privacy

      Consequence: Possibly losing your job for pushing back or just being instructed to proceed with his vision regardless.

   3. Implement the feature how the CEO envisioned it  
      Consequence: Goes against your own morals. Infringes on client’s privacy especially if the terms and agreements of using the app do not accurately reflect that. Definitely infringes on past users’ privacy as Beerz 1.0 specifically claimed to get rid of location data.  
5. Discuss whether the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct offers any relevant guidance.

   1. Principle 1.1 of “the Code” mentions that the aim “is to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to … personal security, and privacy.” In the case of selling users’ location data there is a real threat to their security if the proper precautions are not taken to truly anonymize the data. It could leak to users’ being easily tracked and having their home addresses discovered.

   2. This ties in to principle 1.2 of the Code which aims to avoid harm which consists of the “unjustified … disclosure of information.” Considering the main reason the CEO wishes to disclose user location data is for a profit, it seems to go against the guidelines of ethical coding.

   3. Yet another principle this situation is in contention with is principle 1.3 on being honest. It is the duty of a computing professional to “provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties.” Considering the past users whose data was inadvertently stored, unless the company has a plan to inform those users that their data is now going to be sold, proceeding to sell their data breaches the trust the users had in the app. From what the CTO described, the original Beerz 1.0 was not designed to store users’ location data and if it was marketed as such changing that now without full disclosure might even constitute a breach of contract.

   4. Finally, the last principle that offers some guidance for this situation is principle 1.6 about respecting privacy. The principle makes note of the importance of “taking precautions to prevent re-identification of anonymized data.” This is something that the company will have to take into consideration were they to move forward with the CEOs suggestion. Furthermore, the guideline states how important it is to communicate how the data is used and stored. Thus, the company would have to be very upfront about wanting to sell the data for profit. They would also have to ensure that they obtain the users’ consent meaning they would not be able to use the past users data as they did not consent to having their data sold.

6. Describe and justify your recommended action, as well as your answers to any other questions you presented in part A.

   1. As people who value data privacy very highly, we would recommend trying to push back on the CEO’s vision and sticking to the data privacy ideology that was in place in Beerz 1.0.

   2. If the CEO insists, we would look for another job if possible, otherwise we would try to implement the CEO's version as ethically as possible. This includes:

      1. Leaving out and destroying past users’ data as they did not consent to having their data sold or stored 

      2. Taking extra precautions to anonymize the data to protect users’ privacy

      3. Fully disclosing the changes in how users’ data is managed in a newly updated terms of agreement document as well as through notifications on the app.

      4. Providing an opt-out option for users.
