## Project Proposal
**Project Topic:** Replicating the Morris Worm

**Partners:** Aadi, Lazuli, Liam
### Project Description
In depth research on the Morris Worm with our own implementation of a worm.  We shall show how a hole in the security of a machine can be exploited to spread a worm. We plan to implement this on a network of VMs using default SSH credentials.
### Deliverables
* Brief presentation on what worms are and how they can be used to attack computers.
* Demonstration of our worm infecting a network of VMs using default SSH credentials.
